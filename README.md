# Skin_Cancer_Prediction

## Alliance Skin Care Center

# Project Overview
The Alliance Skin Care Center project aims to revolutionize the early detection of skin cancer using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a user-friendly web application. This platform allows users to upload dermoscopic images to a CNN-based model that predicts various types of skin cancer, such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and others. The project seeks to enhance early diagnosis and provide a convenient way for doctors and patients to interact.

# Features
Image Analysis: Users can upload dermoscopic images for analysis by the machine learning model to get predictions on skin cancer types.
Appointment Booking: The platform allows users to book appointments with dermatologists.
Location-Based Services: An interactive map showing nearby dermatologists and contact information.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, the interface is easy to navigate for both medical professionals and patients.

#Technology Stack
Front-End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome for a responsive and attractive user interface.
Back-End: Python with Flask, JavaScript, and Ajax for server-side logic and asynchronous communication.
Machine Learning: TensorFlow for the CNN model, OpenCV (cv2) for image processing, and various Python libraries for model training and prediction.
Database: MySQL for storing appointment and user-related information.
Email Integration: Flask-Mail for sending appointment confirmations and other communications.

# Usage
Once the project is set up and running, users can:
Access the platform through a web browser.
Upload dermoscopic images for analysis.
Book appointments with dermatologists.
View nearby dermatologists on the interactive map.
Communicate securely with healthcare providers.
